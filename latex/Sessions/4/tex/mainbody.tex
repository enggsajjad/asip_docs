\section*{Motivation and introduction}

In this session we synthesis our basis CPU with Xilinx ISE and execute a
test application on real hardware. The synthesis reports tell us how
much area and power is consumed by our CPU and what is the critical path
of our design. In this session, we will compile a C-code application
direct its output the LCD and UART with the help of some predefined
libraries. This session also introduces about different peripheral where
we forward our text/data, and how different libraries are used for
different peripherals. For every part, that starts like ``a)'', ``b)''
\ldots{} you have to mail the answers and asked files/tables to
\textbf{sajjad.hussain@kit.edu} and use the topic ``asipXX-Session3'',
with XX replaced by your group number.

\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Preparing your project}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
		You can use the same project as in the last session, and just create
		a separate application subdirectory the application. You can start a
		fresh project as in the Session 1, but this would be time consuming.
		\item
		For the C application, you have to create two subdirectories in the
		``\emph{Application}'' directory e.g. ``\emph{Hello\_SW}'' and
		``\emph{Hello\_HW}''. Copy your application from
		``\emph{/home/ces-asip00/Sessions/Session4/app.c}'' to these. This is a
		simple example to direct a text to some peripheral devices like LCD
		or UART. ``\emph{Hello\_SW}'' is aimed for dlxsim and ModelSim
		simulations and ``\emph{Hello\_HW}'' is aimed for real hardware
		implementation.
		\item
		Copy a ``\emph{Makefile}'' file from the ``\emph{TestPrint}''
		application subdirectory to each application subdirectory.
		\item
		Set proper parameters and settings in ``\emph{env\_settings}.
		\item
		For these exercises, we will be using pipeline forwarding (-pf1)
		option which is the default one.
		\item
		Make sure that you already have VHDL files and GNU tools in your
		project's meister directory.
	\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Compiling and ModelSim Simulation}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
		First, you have to compile the application using gcc compiler to
		compare with the later results from dlxsim and ModelSim. For
		\emph{gcc} you can forward the printed output to a file, e.g.
		``\emph{a.out \textgreater{} output\_gcc.txt}'' (`\emph{a.out}' is
		the default name of the binary that is created when you compile
		``\emph{gcc arrayloop.c}'' while `\emph{output\_gcc.txt}' then
		contains the printed array). To compile with GCC, comment the line
		``\emph{\#define ASIP}''.
		\item
		However, for compiling it, you first need to provide the required
		libraries from /home/ces-asip00/epp/StdLib to your respective
		application, i.e. copy ``\emph{lib\_lcd\_dlxsim.c}'',
		``\emph{lib\_uart.c}'', ``\emph{loadStoreByte.c}'',
		``\emph{string.c}'' and respective header files to ``Hello\_SW''
		directory. Also, copy ``\emph{lib\_lcd\_320.c}'',
		``\emph{lib\_uart.c}'', ``\emph{loadStoreByte.c}'',
		``\emph{string.c}'' and respective header files to ``Hello\_HW''
		directory.
		\item
		Go to your application subdirectory ``Hello\_SW'', and type
		``\emph{\textbf{make clean}}'' clean this directory it there are
		previously generated files.
		\item
		In the directory ``Hello\_SW'', compile the C application using
		``\emph{\textbf{make sim}}''. A directory
		``\emph{\textbf{BUILD\_SIM}}'' is created which contains different
		temporary files and a .dlxsim file to be simulated in dlxsim. In
		this directory, the files ``\emph{\textbf{TestData.IM}}'' and
		``\emph{\textbf{TestData.DM}}''are the file used during the ModelSim
		simulation.
		\item
		Simulate your application in dlxsim simulator using
		``\emph{\textbf{make dlxsim}}'', just to verify the functionality.
		For dlxsim you can forward the LCD/UART output to a file, using the
		``-lf'' and ``-uf'' parameters respectively, e.g. ``make dlxsim
		DLXSIM\_PARAM=''-da0 --pf1 -lflcd.out -ufuart.out'' writes output to
		the file ``lcd.out'' and ``uart.out'' in the application directory.
		\item
		In your project directory, go to the ``ModelSim'' directory and
		start the ModelSim using ``vsim''. You can use the previous ModelSim
		project and simulate the application. Remember to generate VCD files
		required for power estimation while doing ModelSim simulation.
		\item
		After compiling, simulate the application in dlxsim and ModelSim and
		compare whether the printed results are the same as expected. The
		dlxsim and ModelSim will print text to a virtual LCD/UART. While
		ModelSim automatically writes to the file ``lcd.out'' and
		``uart.out''.

\item \textbf{Xilinx ISE Framework for Hardware Implementation}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item
		Go to your application subdirectory ``Hello\_HW'', and type
		``\emph{\textbf{make clean}}'' clean this directory it there are
		previously generated files.

		``\emph{\textbf{make sim}}''.
