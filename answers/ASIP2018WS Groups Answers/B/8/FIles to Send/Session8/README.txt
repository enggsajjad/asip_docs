The basis CPU is called browstd32
There are 2 area optimized CPUs, the first one is the browstd32AO which has only some optimizations and the v2 version which is the last one fully working
In the other hand browstd32PO is The performance optimization, as I said in the presentation, the Micro-Instructions STEP4a STEP4b arent working at all so keep in mind
Finally just ignore the browstd32EO, it has no changes.
