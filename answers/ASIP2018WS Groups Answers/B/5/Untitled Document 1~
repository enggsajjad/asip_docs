we have found that if we want to optimize the code by replacing  
    ;eltu   
    ;brz   

by
    bgeu   

we should chenge it to bg without equal, we can do this by delete '=' in the Implementation of 'bgeu'


another thing I would like to mention, the .Lx with '.' will not work. it should be replaced by _Lx.
