a: the internal Loop will be executed 190 times.

b: When there is Exchange: Index has 6 / address has 3

   When there is no Exchange: Index has 2/ address has 1

the reason behind this difference is  we have written on Registers instead of memory and we have read *j before internal Loop.

c: 11431 clock cycles

d: 11012 clock cycles for optimized code

e: the speedup is about 4%



we have found that if we want to optimize the code by replacing  
    ;eltu   
    ;brz   

by
    bgeu   

we should chenge it to bg without equal, we can do this by delete '=' in the Implementation of 'bgeu'


another thing I would like to mention, the .Lx with '.' will not work. it should be replaced by _Lx.
