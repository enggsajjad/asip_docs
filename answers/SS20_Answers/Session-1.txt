19.a) The pipline has 4 Steps: fetch -> decode -> exec -> memory_read/memory_write. Memory read and write are packed together in one single stage.
   b) The function set tab lists the functions and the implementaion of the operations the ALU can perform
   c) The GPR has 1 input port for data and 2 output ports for data
   d) The CPU has 2 forwarding units with 3 32 bit forwarding inputs and 1 32 bit forwarding output each
   e) We would need an additional forwarding output
   f) Regsiter 0-7 of the register bank is used for programm navigation holding information like stack pointer and link register
   g) The CPU uses sopecial instructions SP to perform operations without register access NOP/RETI. You can emulate the NOP with a JP instruction with offset 1.
   h) ForwardDataFromWB:  forward data to a GPR[dest] from stage WB
       ForwardDataFromEXE: forward data to a GPR[dest] from stage EXE
   i) Prefetches Data from register and checks wheter a forwarded value or the register value itself shall be used.
   j) the alu flag contains additional flags produced by the computation. The flags are carry zero sign  and overflow 
   k) See j

26. a) With this information you can determine the size of the text(instructions) and the data(compile time constants)
      b)  0x0:    0x21080481
          0x4:    0x294a0481
          0x8:    0x318c0481
          0xc:    0x00170120
          0x10:   0x00170160
          0x14:   0xeffc2128
          0x18:   0xeffc2968
          0x1c:   0xfffc2907
          0x20:   0xfff828c7
          0x24:   0xfff82160
        
          These are the instruction codes for the first 10 instructions

    c) The first word indicates the stack pointer. The stack pointer shrinks while the stack itself is increasing. Or in other words, a typical stack 
       implementation.
    d) 775 Cycles
